## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.2 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Redis 7.0 or higher
- PostgreSQL 14 or higher

### Running with Docker Compose

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shashidharbabu/api-gateway.git
   cd API_gateway_with_ratelimiting_and_Jwt_validation
   ```

2. Start the services:
   ```bash
   cd docker
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. The API Gateway will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Running Locally

1. Set up the development environment:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/dev-setup.sh
   ```

2. Start dependencies (PostgreSQL and Redis):
   ```bash
   # Using Docker for dependencies
   docker run -d --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=2405 -e POSTGRES_DB=apigateway -p 5432:5432 postgres:14
   docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7
   ```

3. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/init-db.sh
   ```

4. Run the gateway:
   ```bash
   make run
   # or
   go run cmd/gateway/main.go
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run benchmarks
make benchmark

# Run specific test
go test -run TestLoginEndpoint ./tests/
```

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Request Flow**:
   - Client sends request to the gateway
   - Gateway validates JWT token (if required)
   - Content moderation check is performed (for POST/PUT/PATCH requests)
   - Rate limiting check is performed (per-route configuration)
   - Request is routed using optimized lookup (hash-map + prefix-tree)
   - Response is returned to client

2. **Content Moderation**:
   - **Basic Keyword Filtering**: 80+ spam keywords across 10 categories
   - **LLM Integration**: AI-powered content analysis with multiple providers
   - **JSON Structure Analysis**: Recursive scanning of nested JSON payloads
   - **Fallback Mechanisms**: Basic rules when AI services are unavailable
   - **Categories Detected**:
     - Promotional spam (buy now, get rich quick, etc.)
     - Phishing attempts (account verification, security alerts)
     - Cryptocurrency spam (trading bots, investment schemes)
     - Social media spam (follow me, link in bio)
     - Medical spam (miracle cures, weight loss)
     - Tech support scams (virus detected, call now)
     - Hate speech and harassment
     - Adult/inappropriate content
     - MLM and pyramid schemes
     - Misinformation indicators

3. **LLM Provider Support**:
   - **OpenAI GPT-4**: Advanced natural language understanding
   - **Anthropic Claude**: Constitutional AI approach
   - **Hugging Face**: Open-source model integration
   - **Local Models**: Ollama or self-hosted solutions
   - **Confidence Scoring**: 0.0-1.0 probability assessment
   - **Detailed Reasoning**: AI explanations for moderation decisions
   - **Content Suggestions**: Improvement recommendations for blocked content

4. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Uses Redis-based token bucket algorithm
   - Configurable limits per route/service
   - Distributed rate limiting support
   - Per-user and per-service rate limiting

5. **Route Optimization**:
   - Hash-map for O(1) exact matches
   - Prefix-tree for pattern matching
   - 20% performance improvement over simple map lookup
   - Automatic fallback between optimization strategies

6. **Admin APIs**:
   - CRUD operations for route management
   - Real-time route statistics
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Dynamic route updates without restart

```

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Route Lookup Optimization

The gateway implements a dual-strategy approach for route matching:

1. **Hash-Map Lookup**: O(1) time complexity for exact matches
2. **Prefix-Tree Lookup**: Efficient pattern matching for complex routes
3. **Smart Fallback**: Automatic selection of the most efficient method

### Benchmark Results

Typical performance improvements:
- **Hash-Map**: ~0.1μs per lookup
- **Prefix-Tree**: ~0.3μs per lookup  
- **Optimized**: ~0.15μs per lookup (with fallback)
- **Improvement**: ~20% faster than simple map lookup
